e:T4b4,After finished my high school I won a regional scholarship in 2006 to study my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering in Mekelle institute of Technology, Mekelle, Ethiopia, an institution that enrolls students from high school that have high entrance exam for universities. And I successfully completed my study in 2010 and graduated with a Very great Distinction. In addition to the course works, I did my thesis work on Image Steganography; hiding a secrete data inside an image; this thesis has been pursued by Professor Manoj V.N.V in 2010 at Mekelle Institute of Technology. The aim of the entire thesis was to implement and analyze the Least Significant bit algorithm; an algorithm to hide a data inside an image. We implement the algorithm and analyze the effect on different image types i.e., JPG, GIF, and TIF and the results indicates that, data that are covered in JPG images are not noticeable by our eye if we embed the data on the last bit of the pixel on the image, Whereas, if we use the last two bits of the pixel to replace by the data it can be noticeable by the naked eye. In this work I understood how to do a research, specifically to answer the research questions.0:{"P":null,"b":"5o7RYHhk7nnOLQfjYgLb_","p":"","c":["","PersonalStatement"],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["PersonalStatement",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$3","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/4002a9a530bae511.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","link","1",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/da1e042cefb79cbe.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"children":["$","$L4",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"app-container","children":[["$","$L5",null,{}],["$","main",null,{"className":"main-content","children":["$","$L6",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L7",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":"404"}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],"notFoundStyles":[]}]}],["$","$L8",null,{"justify":"center","align":"center","direction":"row","w":"100%","p":"md","style":{"minHeight":"60px"},"children":["$","$L8",null,{"align":"center","children":[["$","$L9",null,{"children":"follow me on"}],["$","$La",null,{"pl":5,"pr":5,"href":"https://x.com/eliaswendm","label":"Twitter","color":"green","variant":"subtle","style":{"color":"gray","width":"auto"}}],["$","$L9",null,{"children":"&"}],["$","$La",null,{"pl":5,"pr":5,"href":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elias-atalay-504a1130/","label":"Linkdlen","color":"green","variant":"subtle","style":{"color":"gray","width":"auto"}}]]}]}]]}]}]}]}]]}],{"children":["PersonalStatement",["$","$3","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L6",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","PersonalStatement","children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L7",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["__PAGE__",["$","$3","c",{"children":[["$","$Lb",null,{"h":"80vh","color":"red","size":"lg","p":"md","children":[["$","$Lc",null,{"c":"rgb(107, 107, 132)","children":"Personal Statement"}],["$","$Ld",null,{"h":"md"}],["$","$L9",null,{"className":"text-content","children":"Knowing how things work has been my interest for a long time now and ever since I joined high school, physics and mathematics have been my favorite subjects.
