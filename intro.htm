      <h3>Personal Statement</h3>
      <p>Knowing how things work has been my interest for a long time now and ever since I joined high school, 
        physics and mathematics have been my favorite subjects. I enjoy applying scientific knowledge in coming up 
        with solutions to everyday challenges and in understanding the principles behind the operations of various 
        engineering inventions. During the second year in high school, even though I had limited knowledge in physics, 
        I was among those who participated in the Regional Science Congress. This was a forum where high school students 
        showcased their scientific prowess by coming up with projects addressing specific challenges facing our society in general. 
        Even though I did not emerge the winner, but it marked a major milestone in my future carrier as it exposed me to the challenges 
        faced by engineers.</p> 
      
      <p>After finished my high school I won a regional scholarship in 2006 to study my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and 
        Engineering in Mekelle institute of Technology, Mekelle, Ethiopia, an institution that enrolls students from high school 
        that have high entrance exam for universities. And I successfully completed my study in 2010 and graduated with a Very great 
        Distinction. In addition to the course works, I did my thesis work on Image Steganography; hiding a secrete data inside an image; 
        this thesis has been pursued by Professor Manoj V.N.V in 2010 at Mekelle Institute of Technology. The aim of the entire thesis was
        to implement and analyze the Least Significant bit algorithm; an algorithm to hide a data inside an image. We implement the 
        algorithm and analyze the effect on different image types i.e., JPG, GIF, and TIF and the results indicates that, data that 
        are covered in JPG images are not noticeable by our eye if we embed the data on the last bit of the pixel on the image, Whereas, 
        if we use the last two bits of the pixel to replace by the data it can be noticeable by the naked eye. In this work I understood 
        how to do a research, specifically to answer the research questions.</p> 
      
      <p>Immediately after graduating from Mekelle Institute of Technology, I started to work in an industrial company in Mekelle, 
      Ethiopia as System Engineer and I was developing embedded software’s using C, C++ and Java. Even though, my work was not related 
      to research and development, but I gained the experience to work as a team and to perform a specific task as an individual.</p>
  
      <p> After working from 2010 to 2012 I understood to continue studying in developed countries and to explore the emerging 
        ideas in digital technologies, and I get an admission to study Master degree in Embedded Computing Systems in Scuola Superiore 
        Sant’anna and University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy (Jointly). And I deeply understand the concepts: Real Time Embedded System Design, 
        Embedded System Design using Model based design and Real time kernel, Concurrent Distributed systems, Digital System Design, 
        Optimization Methods, Digital Control and Mechatronics, Robotics and human machine interface, Computational Intelligence, 
        and Internet of Things.   </p>
      
      <p> My enthusiasm to pursue my career in the research area stems after I joined the MSc to specialize Embedded Computing Systems. 
        During my graduate studies I have had experiences and skills working in projects more specifically in Embedded Systems software 
        development using C, C++, Java, Python, and nesC. Moreover, my final thesis was dealt with Design and Analysis of Routing 
        Protocol for IPv6, in which an extensive performance evaluation of the routing protocols is studied and proposed a modified 
        version of the existing Routing Protocol that forms the best paths with less energy consumption which s already validated by 
        our simulation results. And I ended with a final mark of 30/30.</p>
      
      <p> With this being junior graduating student I understand the need to be able to pick things up quickly and 
        I can assure you that during my stay in your research team I would prove to be a valuable asset. </p>
      
      <p>It would be an honor to discuss with you my resume either personally or by a Skype interview. 
        I am looking forward to hopefully hearing from you.</p>
        
      <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

      <p>Elias Wendm Atalay </p>
